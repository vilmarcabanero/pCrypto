As a developer, I want the app to use ROOM to cache the coins list, and use the data from ROOM as the main source of data when the app is launched.
- when the app loads for the first time, the local DB is empty, thus use the data from remote. Then store that data locally.
So that, when the app is loaded again, it will use the data stored locally.

As a user, I want a search box at the top of the home/coins list screen, where when I type the coin name, it will filter all coins that have that name.
- for example, if I type "the", all coins that contains "the" in their name will be filtered.
i.e. "Ethereum (ETH)", "Tether (USDT)", "The Open Network (TONCOIN)", etc.
- this should be a use case. SearchCoin. The coins list it will be getting is from the GetCoins use case, which should not know
where the data is coming from (whether it came from local DB or remote API)
